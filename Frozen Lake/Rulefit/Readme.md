# Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder is used to store the code of Rulefit algorithm.  
Rulefit Extracts rules from a decision tree then builds a sparse linear model with them.  
The model used in this project is based on [**imodels** by Chandan Singh](https://github.com/csinva/imodels.git).

# Instruction
------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the code includes the controller of Rulefit in the Frozen Lake. So the environment code should be in the same path.
