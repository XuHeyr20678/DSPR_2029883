# Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This floder is used to store the code of **Greedy Rule List**.  
Greedy Rule List uses CART to learn a list (only a single path), rather than a decision tree.  
The model used in this project is based on [**imodels** by Chandan Singh](https://github.com/csinva/imodels.git).  

# Instruction
------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the code includes the controller of Greedy Rule List in the Frozen Lake. So the environment code should be in the same path.
