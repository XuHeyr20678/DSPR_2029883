# Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder is used to store the code of CN2 algorithm. The model used in this project is based on [**cn2-rule-based-classifier** by Alessia Mondolo](https://github.com/alessiamondolo/cn2-rule-based-classifier.git).

# Instruction
------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the code includes the controller of CN2 in the Frozen Lake. So the environment code should be in the same path.
