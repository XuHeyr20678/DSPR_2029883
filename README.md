Analysis of XAI algorithms for Black-Box Reinforcement Learner
This is the MSc individual project of Data Science at the University of Bristol.
The project is about the XAI algorithms for Black-Box Policy in the Reinforcement Learning. 
The environments of this project are the improved Frozen Lake and Lunar Lander. They are based on the Open AI Gym.
The XAI algorithms in this project are Greedy Rule List, CN2 and Rulefit.
All of the codes are showed in this repository.
