# Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder is used to store the code of **Greedy Rule List**.  
Greedy Rule List uses CART to learn a list (only a single path), rather than a decision tree.  
The model used in this project is based on [**imodels** by Chandan Singh](https://github.com/csinva/imodels.git).
